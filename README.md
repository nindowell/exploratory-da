## EDA on the Global Country Information Dataset 2023

In this Jupyter Notebook, I've conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the GCI dataset for the year 2023.

**Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
  - Ensured correct data types for the analysis.

**Correlation Analysis**:
  - Computed a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features.
  - Visualized the correlations using a `heatmap` to detect strong associations.

**Data Visualization**:
  - Used both static (`matplotlib` and `seaborn`) and interactive (`plotly`) plotting libraries.
  - Produced scatter plots to further delve into the relationships between specific features.
